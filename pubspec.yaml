  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - assets/fonts/
     - assets/icons/
     - assets/icons/2.0x/
     - assets/icons/3.0x/
     - assets/samples/
     - assets/samples/2.0x/
     - assets/samples/3.0x/

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: OpenSans
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf
           weight: 700
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBold.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-ExtraBoldItalic.ttf
           weight: 800
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Italic.ttf
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Light.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-LightItalic.ttf
           weight: 300
           style: italic
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
         - asset: assets/fonts/OpenSans-SemiBold.ttf
